                    <p>If you receive a Gold card, your minimum monthly payment for any given billing period is due by the date specified on the monthly statement for that period. If your minimum monthly payment for a billing period (the <strong>"first"</strong>                        billing period) is not received and remains outstanding by the due date of the <strong>second</strong> billing period, your rates will increase to<strong>29.9%.</strong> These new rates will be in effect on the <strong>first</strong>                        day of the third billing period.</p>
                    <p>
                        <Strong>Example:</Strong> If you miss the minimum payment due date for your <strong>December</strong> billing period, it’s very important to make your overdue minimum payment by the due date of your <strong>January</strong> billing period – otherwise your
                        rates will go up starting on the <strong>first</strong> day in your <strong>February</strong> billing period.</p>
                    <p>Once the increased rate is in effect, if we receive your minimum monthly payment by the due date for <strong>9</strong> consecutive billing periods, your rates will change back to the Standard Rates that apply to your account as defined
                        above, starting from the <strong>first</strong> day of the <strong>10<sup>th</sup> </strong> billing period.</p>

        <p>You are guaranteed approval for a Capital One MasterCard.® If we are unable to issue you a Gold MasterCard, you will qualify for a Secured <br> MasterCard requiring security funds of $75 or $300. Benefits may differ depending on the card you receive.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Guaranteed Terms</strong><br> You’re guaranteed to be approved – as long as you:
            <ol>
                <li>Are at least the age of majority in your province or territory of residence;</li>
                <li>Don’t have an existing Capital One account or a pending application for one;</li>

                <li>Provide security funds, if you’re approved for a Secured MasterCard</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition, we have a number of checkpoints to ensure your identity stays safe. If we're unable to confirm your identity during the application<br> process, you'll need to go to a Canada Post outlet and provide further identification.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Agreement to Terms</strong><br> If I am approved for a Secured card product, I agree to be bound by the terms of the Security Account Assignment Agreement. I understand that my security funds will be used as collateral to secure my
            credit card obligations. By submitting the Application Form, I am requesting that a credit card and security account to track my security funds be established in my name. I agree to be bound by the terms of the Capital One Customer Agreement;
            Security Agreement; and Security Account Maintenance Fee Schedule & Account Agreement Supplement that will be given to me after my account is open, and future revisions thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong> Security Account Assignment Agreement  </strong><br> In this agreement, the words “I,” “my,” and “me” refer to the Applicant. As security for the performance of all of my obligations relating to my credit card account (“Account”),
            including repayment of all credit extended through my Account, I pledge and grant Capital One Bank and its assignees (collectively “Capital One”), a first-priority security interest in all funds, including any interest on such funds, now or
            hereafter delivered by me to Capital One (the “Funds”) as of the date of my delivery of such Funds to Capital One. Capital One will commingle the security Funds with other funds and will hold these Funds in a trust account (the “Deposit Account”)
            with a member institution of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation to be selected from time to time by Capital One. Capital One will establish a security account to track and account for my Funds. I unconditionally relinquish all possession
            and control over the Funds and acknowledge that Capital One will have full access to the Funds in the Deposit Account. Because the Funds are security for the credit card, withdrawals from the Deposit Account are prohibited. I agree to pay
            all charges and fees relating to my Account and the Funds, as disclosed to me from time to time by Capital One. I will not grant any other party any interest in the Funds. I also understand that my Funds will not be returned to me until all
            my indebtedness with respect to my Account is fully satisfied, all credit cards and access cheques have been returned to Capital One and all of my other obligations have been performed. If I have made a false or misleading material statement
            in the Application Form, if I exceed my credit limit, or otherwise default under the terms of the Capital One Customer Agreement or Security Agreement, or if Capital One or I terminate my Account, Capital One may, without notice to me or demand
            for payment, withdraw amounts from my Funds and apply such amounts in satisfaction of any obligations with respect to my Account. In addition, Capital One may exercise any other remedies permitted by my Account or the laws of the Province
            of Ontario. If Capital One hires an attorney to enforce its rights with respect to my Account or the Funds, I agree to pay Capital One all reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs that Capital One has paid. These provisions are supplemented
            by the Security Agreement between me and Capital One; in the event of any inconsistency, the terms of the Security Agreement shall control.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Terms of Offer</strong><br> By submitting the Application Form, the applicant ("I"):<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Certify that the information provided is true and correct and understand that Capital One Bank (Canada Branch), ("Capital One"), will rely on this and other information in deciding to open a MasterCard Account ("Account");</li>
                <li>Request that Capital One open an Account and issue appropriate MasterCard card(s) ("Card(s)") and Personal Identification Number(s) to me (including renewals and replacements from time to time);</li>
                <li>Request that Capital One issue appropriate Cards to me for any Authorized User identified on the Application Form, as well as renewals and replacements from time to time;</li>
                <li>Agree that use of the Account or Card(s) will confirm acceptance of Capital One's MasterCard Customer Agreement as amended from time to time (the "Agreement"), which will be sent with my Card(s) if approved;</li>
                <li>Agree that I will be liable for any use of these Card(s) and all amounts charged to the Account. If, without my authorization, the Account is accessed by use of my Account Access cheques, card number, card, or my card and my PIN together
                    in an ABM or similar equipment, I will not be held liable. If Capital One's investigation establishes that no misuse of the account, card, card number or PIN occurred, I will be liable for all transactions;</li>
                <li>Acknowledge that if I am currently a Capital One cardholder or have applied for more than one Capital One account within the last 30 days, I will not be approved for this offer; and</li>
                <li>
                    Acknowledge that if I am currently a Capital One cardholder with a credit card account that is in delinquency or have had a Capital One account which has been charged off in the last year, I will not be approved for this offer.
